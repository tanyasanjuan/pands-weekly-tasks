# Pands Weekly Tasks

This repository contains the solutions for the Programming and Scripting weekly tasks module.

## 📁 Repository Structure 
Each weekly task is organized into its own directory. The directories are named according to the week (e.g., week01, week02,...week08).

Within each directory, you could find:

◽ A Python file with the code solution.

◽ All relevant explanations and task details written as comments within the Python file itself.

This approach aims to help keep the repository clean and focused on the task.

## 📑 About the Tasks 
The tasks are designed to:

◽ Test the knowledge acquired in each lesson and lab.

◽ Encourage independent problem-solving.

◽ Require external research to find and apply appropriate solutions.

◽ To be carried out weekly, however improvements will be allowed until 28th April 2025.

## 💬 Comments & Documentation
All Python files are commented to: 

◽ Explain the problem being solved. 

◽ Describes the logic behind the code. 

◽ Provide references and sources where necessary and applicable. 

## 📚 Research & References
◽ Throughout the weekly tasks, research and external resources have been cited.

◽ This information has been added to support learning and demonstrate my understanding.

◽ These references can be found in the code comments or in links from reliable sources, such as:
- [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## ✅ Repossitory Submission
◽ This repossitory helps to demonstrate my understanding and progression with each task.

◽ This repository (pands-weekly-tasks) includes:
- Weekly task solutions only.
- This concise and clear README.md file.


## 📜 Additional Notes
◽ This is a separate repossitory from (pands-mywork) and (pands-project).

◽ Most of the tasks have been attempted progressively, and I’ve revisited earlier ones to improve them over time.
